If you are on this page, that means the Adobe PDF Library installation for .NET failed due to a firewall. Aggravating!

### **Let’s get this fixed!**

License activation can make use of a user-defined Proxy Server and will attempt to automatically detect it on Windows.

Otherwise, set the Environment Variable **HTTP\_PROXY** to the hostname and port number separated by a colon.

::alert{type="info"}
_For example, to utilize the HTTP Proxy Server running on myproxyhost on port 8765:_

> **On Windows:  set HTTP\_PROXY=myproxyhost:8765**
>
> **On Other Platforms:  export HTTP\_PROXY=myproxyhost:8765**
::

If your Proxy Server uses authentication, set the Environment Variable HTTP\_PROXY\_CREDENTIALS to the username and password, separated by a colon.

::alert{type="info"}
_For example, if your username is user and password is password:_

> **On Windows:  set HTTP\_PROXY\_CREDENTIAL=”user\:password”**
>
> **On Other Platforms:  export HTTP\_PROXY\_CREDENTIAL=”user\:password”**
::
