PDF2PRINT is a powerful scriptable server tool used to print PDF documents. Built upon the Adobe PDF Library, it prints files with the consistency and reliability expected from Adobe products.

With PDF2PRINT, users can send PDF files to any printer manually, or by implementing enterprise-level integration for server-based automated batch process workflows. By doing this, users achieve fast and efficient printing with exceptionally small PostScript spool files – especially important for print output to remote sites.

This command line tool can correctly process virtually any type of PDF document, regardless of its size, age, format, or embedded features. It supports PDF Archive (PDF/A) - designed to create documents intended for long-term preservation, and PDF/X - used by the graphic arts and printing community where color accuracy is an absolute requirement.
