Datalogics PDF Checker detects PDF problems before they affect your workflows. This command-line tool programmatically scans digital documents to identify user-specified conditions that limit a document's ability to be launched, viewed, interacted with and otherwise processed.  

Designed to identify potential issues with PDF files such as color spaces, image resolution, font embedding, metadata, and more, it provides detailed reports and alerts on potential problems that may cause printing or rendering issues. Manually review one PDF document at a time or set up a workflow to review hundreds of PDF documents automatically.
