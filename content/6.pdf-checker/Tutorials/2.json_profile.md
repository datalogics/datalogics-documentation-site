## Turning options on or off

You can create your own JSON profile by editing the JSON profile we provide and removing options you don’t want. Or you can simply turn an option off. Set the “check” value to “off”:

```js
"objects": {
   "contains-javascript-actions": {
       "check": "off",
       "report-as-error": "off",
       "report-message": "Contains JavaScript actions",
       "abort-remaining-checks": "off"
```

## Abort remaining checks

The “abort-remaining-checks” value appears for every setting. You can set up PDF Checker so that it stops its analysis of a given PDF document if it encounters a condition that you select. This saves processing time; PDF Checker abandons the current document if it finds a critical error. If you are running PDF Checker as a batch process, it will move on to scan the next PDF file in the directory.

Two conditions will cause the PDF Checker review process to stop processing immediately whether the “abort-remaining-checks” condition is turned on or not.

- **unable-to-open.** The document has an invalid format and cannot be opened, or it is not really a PDF file, or the file is named in the command line statement but is not in the directory.
- **password-protected.** The document requires a password to open and view, but the password was not provided with the command line statement.

:br

A third condition might cause the review process to stop immediately if the PDF document cannot be repaired.

- **damaged.** The document is corrupted and PDF Checker cannot open the file.

PDF Checker includes a document repair feature. If PDF Checker finds it cannot open a PDF document, it will run the repair process for the file, and store an updated version of the file in memory with those changes applied, but without changing the file itself. A similar feature in Adobe Acrobat allows a user to save a repaired document and apply those repairs. PDF Checkerdoes not make any changes to the initial document or allow the saving of a repaired document. Other Datalogics products can be used for that.

If PDF Checker still can’t open the PDF document after repairing it, the system will stop processing the document and mark it as damaged. If PDF Checker can open the repaired file, it will run through its normal review process, but the review might not complete successfully. If one of the reviews fails, PDF Checker will stop processing the document, and it will only report on the reviews that completed. For example, if PDF Checker can identify and list the fonts in a repaired PDF document but fails when seeking to process the images in that document, checks made during processing images will be reported as aborted.

Suppose you set the “abort-remaining-checks” value to “on” for the “contains-annots-without-normal-appearances” condition, like this:

```js
"contains-annots-without-normal-appearances": {
     "check": "on",
         "report-as-error": "off",
         "report-message": "Contains annotations without default normal appearances. 
                            These may not be displayed correctly by all PDF viewers",
         "abort-remaining-checks": "on"
```

In this example, the first time PDF Checker finds annotations without normal appearances in a PDF document, it stops all further processing for that document. Since PDF Checker can run multi-threaded, however, and thus complete multiple checks at one time, the actual remaining checks that are not processed can vary, depending on when the abort signal is received. For example, one thread could be checking fonts in a PDF document while another is looking at images. The thread checking fonts might not be finished, or where it breaks off might vary from one PDF document to another, when PDF Checker abandons the PDF file. As a result, the output results might vary, too. The check that causes the process to abort is shown in the output report.

## Reporting an issue as an error or information

PDF Checker evaluates a PDF document for each setting included in you JSON profile and generates a record for each result. If you were to export your results to a text file, part of the report might look like this:

::alert
```mdc
Fonts Results
 Errors:
   Uses fonts not embedded in document: 
     Arial (1 instance)
     Arial,Bold (1 instance)
     CourierStd (1 instance)
     Meiryo (1 instance)
     Murdana (3 instances)
     TimesNewRoman (1 instance)
     TimesNewRoman,Italic (1 instance)
```
::

:br

Note the options in the JSON Profile to report as error, and the error message:

```js
"fonts": {
   "uses-fonts-not-embedded": {
       "check": "on",
       "report-as-error": "on",
       "report-message": "Uses fonts not embedded in document",
       "abort-remaining-checks": "off"
```

:br

You can use these settings to flag a result specifically as an error in the output results. Set “report-aserror” to “on” and the result will appear under the heading “Errors” in the export file, as shown above. You can also edit the message that appears by changing the value for “report-message.” You could change the error message from this:

```js
"report-as-error": "on",
"report-message": "Uses fonts not embedded in document",
```

:br

to this:

```js
"report-as-error": "on",
"report-message": "These fonts are not found in this PDF document"
```

:br
