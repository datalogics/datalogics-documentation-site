#

The JSON profile file is not required. If you are content to use the default settings provided with the FLIP2PDF software, you can enter a command statement like this:

```json
flip2pdf --input TestDocument.docx --output TestDocument.pdf
```

:br

If you do specify a JSON profile file name in your command statement, you can use either the relative or the absolute path for that file. If you don’t provide an absolute path for the JSON profile, FLIP2PDF will look for the file in the working directory. If the file is not in the working directory, FLIP2PDF will look for the JSON profile in the FLIP2PDFProfiles directory where the product was installed.

If FLIP2PDF can’t find the JSON profile, you will see an error message.

These are the FLIP2PDF default settings:

| output             | PDF file                                                         |
| compression method | jpeg                                                             |
| downsampling       | All images are downsampled by default to 300 DPI                 |
| tagged PDF         | Do not create a tagged PDF document when creating an Office file |

In other words, if you don’t include a JSON profile in your command line statement FLIP2PDF will generate a standard PDF document. The file will not be tagged, and any graphics found in a PostScript or Microsoft source document or on a web page will be downsampled to 300 DPI and compressed using the jpeg compression method. Also, the fonts used by the PDF output file will be embedded in that PDF file.
