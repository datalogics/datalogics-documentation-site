There are no options to enter in the JSON profile for converting graphics image files.

FLIP2PDF does not downsample graphics files when converting them to PDF documents. The product will use the resolution assigned to each BMP, JPEG, TIFF, or PNG file when creating the PDF output. Sometimes, however, an image file does not have resolution information saved with that file. If an image does not have a defined resolution, FLIP2PDF writes it to 72 DPI when generating the output PDF document.

FLIP2PDF uses the flate compression method when converting BMP, PNG, and TIF graphics files to PDF documents. For JPG files, the product uses jpeg compression.

FLIP2PDF preserves transparencies in PNG and TIFF images in the PDF output and preserves the color space for raster images that are RGB, CMYK, or Grayscale. FLIP2PDF does not process TIFF files that use color spaces other than Grayscale, RGB or CMYK.
