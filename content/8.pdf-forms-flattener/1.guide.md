PDF Forms Flattener command-line tool programmatically fills and flattens form content into a standard, flat (non-interactive) PDF document, whether you are working with Acroforms, static XFA or dynamic XFA forms. Flattening prevents further editing while maintaining a consistent viewing experience across all devices. Think of it as “locking in” the values of the form so you can print or distribute the file as a standard PDF that can be viewed and printed wherever PDFs are supported.

Additionally, PDF Forms Flattener understands annotation display requirements by design and applies them prior to flattening. Flattened annotations are preserved within the PDF document, do not require additional annotation specifications, and display as they would in Adobe Acrobat consistently regardless of the PDF viewer.
