Adobe PDF Library (APDFL) .NET objects can be associated with a large amount of unmanaged memory which exerts little memory pressure on the .NET runtime. Therefore, there could be a long period before the garbage collector deletes these objects because it is not aware of the size of the unmanaged or native objects in APDFL.  

Once the garbage collection happens, a large amount of memory associated with objects no longer in use is freed. **It is important then to release the unmanaged resources in APDFL as soon as an object is no longer in use.**   

**To do this, call the Dispose method.** 

In C#, a using statement automatically calls Dispose():  

```js
  using (Page page = doc.GetPage(0)) {  

   }
```
