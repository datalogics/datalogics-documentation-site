We recommend you include **all** the files in the Resources directory with your application because they are used for rendering, conversion, printing, and other operations. Adobe PDF Library will look for the **Resources** directory in a known location. However, custom paths to the individual paths can be specified during the Library Initialization.   

### **Font** 

Font files that cover most typical documents that are used besides OS fonts.   

### **CMap**

### **Joboptions** 

An options file for driving the XPS2PDF plugin.   

### **Color** 

Color profiles utilized during color conversion.   

### **Unicode** 

Unicode mappings utilized during font handling.   

### **OfficeMetrics**
