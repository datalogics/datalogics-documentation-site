## Installing to the local Maven cache

First, ensure the Environmental Variable **JAVA\_HOME** is set to _match_ the location of your Java SDK.

Then make the Maven artifacts available in your local repository:

    _./mvnw -f create-artifacts.xml install_

## Deploying to a remote repository

To deploy to a remote repository, use the **deploy** phase, adding the Server ID (from **\~/.m2/settings.xml**) and the URL to the repository.

    _./mvnw -f create-artifacts.xml -DrepositoryId=SERVER\_ID -Durl=_<http://myurl.com/libs-release-local> _deploy_

(Where _SERVER\_ID_ is the name of the Server ID.)
