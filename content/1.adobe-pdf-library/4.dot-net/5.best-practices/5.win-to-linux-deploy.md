## How to Deploy .NET app from Windows to Linux  

1. Change to the application directory and use the publish command:    **dotnet publish** 

This will create a **publish** folder with dependencies for the program, which can vary depending on the sample.  

2. Run the deployment script that corresponds to the OS you want to deploy. Sample deployment scripts can be found on GitHub.  

_**Please note:**_ The paths used in the scripts are meant as _examples_ of where you would have your local resources actually stored relative to the project. 

For example, the script **PublishToLinux.bat**, will add the remaining dependencies to the **publish** folder. This will include the **Linux\_Dependencies.tar.gz** file which needs to be decompressed with the target application. 

**The dependencies are determined by your deployment OS:** 

Linux\_Dependencies.tar.gz 

Windows\_Dependencies.zip 

macOS\_Dependencies.zip 

3. Run the application:   **dotnet MyApplication.dll**
