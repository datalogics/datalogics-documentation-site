# Directory-level redirects are auto-generated from .navigation.yml files
# by the ~/modules/navigation-redirects module at build time.
# The generated _redirects file is placed in public/ and included in the build output.
# 
# To add/modify redirects, edit the .navigation.yml files via Nuxt Studio:
# - Set `navigation.redirect: /path/to/redirect/to` in any .navigation.yml file
# - The redirect will be generated automatically on the next build
